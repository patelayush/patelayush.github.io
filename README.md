# Ayush Patel

Hey! I am Senior Software Engineer (Android) working at LendingTree since July 2019.
During my Master's in Computer Science from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, I got my inspiration to develop Mobile Applications.
I have developed and designed a wide variety of apps ranging from social media, finance and accounting, to reservation applications.
I love understanding technology, playing around with gadgets and enjoy taking on challenges to solve problems, that has been my motivation for coding.
